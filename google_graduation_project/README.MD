##  Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone** to apply real-world data analysis skills.  
It focuses on analyzing **Cyclistic bike-sharing data** from Chicago to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** use the service differently.  

The ultimate goal is to:  
- Identify key differences between casual riders and members.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.  
- Support marketing strategy decisions with compelling data insights.  

##  Tools and Skills Used  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
- **SQL & Excel** for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.  
- **Google Data Analytics Capstone framework** for structured problem-solving.  
- **Data storytelling and dashboard design** for business decision-making.  

##  Key Features of the Dashboard  
- **Ride Analysis by Bike Type**: docked bike, electric bike, and classic bike usage.  
- **Member vs. Casual Trends**: rides per month, weekday, time of day, and season.  
- **Rides Length Analysis**: total and average ride lengths.  
- **Seasonal & Daily Patterns**: identifying preferred riding seasons and periods.  

##  Common Insights Found  
- **Members ride consistently** throughout the week, while **casual riders peak on weekends** (likely for leisure).  
- **Summer and spring** are the most popular seasons for all riders, indicating weather strongly influences ridership.  
- **Afternoons (14:00–18:00)** show the highest ride counts — after-work hours and moderate weather conditions.  
- **Docked bikes** are the most frequently used, suggesting they should be prioritized.  
- **Casual riders** tend to take longer rides on average, hinting at different motivations compared to members.  

##  Recommendations  
1. **Expand docked bike availability** to meet high demand and improve user experience.  
2. **Promote annual memberships** to casual riders, emphasizing cost savings and convenience.  
3. **Target marketing campaigns** during spring and summer to maximize conversions.  
4. **Highlight health and lifestyle benefits** of bike riding to encourage year-round usage.  

##  Outcome  
This project demonstrates the ability to transform raw trip data into actionable insights that inform marketing and operational strategies.  
It reflects strong competencies in data cleaning, visualization, segmentation, and data storytelling — essential for data-driven business decisions.
